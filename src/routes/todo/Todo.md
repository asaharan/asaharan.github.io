# Todo app

### I want to create a simple todo list app

Why? Because I want to keep track of my tasks.

I don't want to use thousands of softwares, I'm tired of it.
If I build it myself, I can customize it to my needs.

Let's get started.

### Features:

- A task should have title, created at, due date, updated at, update history, status, priority, due date, people involved, tags, description
- Data will be stored in IndexedDB
- Description can be written in markdown
- I can add, edit, delete, mark as done, mark as important, add people, add tags, add description
- Vim shortcuts should be available
- can i use https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores
