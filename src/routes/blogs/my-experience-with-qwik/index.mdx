<h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mb-4">My experience with Qwik</h1>

I have been using [Qwik](https://qwik.dev) for almost 2 years now.
My journey with Qwik has been like a roller-coaster. Sometimes I like it, others, I don't.

Major pointers:

1. Community seems to be very small.
2. Performance is great.
3. LLMs don't work great with it but if you give the right context, they do.
