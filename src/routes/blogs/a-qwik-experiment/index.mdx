<h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mb-4">A Qwik experiment</h1>

<h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-2 mt-2">Why Qwik?</h2>

I always used to wonder
why is so much JavaScript loaded on the browser even when there are no
interactions on the page.

I have been using <a class='link' href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a> for more than 2 years now, and I really like the way it compiles the code to vanilla JavaScript.
But still, it loads some JS. By the way we recently moved away from using Next.JS and started using SvelteKit for our website <a class='link' href="https://www.prepleaf.com">Prepleaf</a>.

A couple of months ago, I came across <a class='link' href="https://qwik.builder.io">Qwik</a>. So yesterday, I decided to give it a try. Qwik seemed precisely the framework I was looking for.

<h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-2 mt-4">Developer experience?</h2>

Setting up a new project is very easy. Just run <code class='inline-code'>pnpm create qwik@latest</code> and you are good to go.

<br />I have used React for the past 5 years, so I feel right at home with Qwik,
as it also uses JSX for templating. Although there are many new things to learn,
the basic functionalities, like importing a component, and passing props, stay
the same.
<br />

<div class="px-4">
  <ol class="list-disc">
    <li>
      <div>Routing: Similar to Next.JS.</div>
      <code class="inline-code">
        {`src/routes/blogs/a-qwik-experiment/index.mdx`}
      </code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>Components: Similar to React but with one major difference that</div>
      <code class="inline-code">
        {`export const TopbarLink = ({(text, href)}: TopbarLinkProps)`}
      </code>
      <span>: Not loaded lazyly</span>
      <br />
      <code class="inline-code">
        {`export const TopbarLink = component$({(text, href)}: TopbarLinkProps)`}
      </code>
      <span>: Lazyly loaded</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      State Management: It has <span class="inline-code">useStore</span>, seems
      very similar to React.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
<br />
As it uses <a class="link" href="https://vitejs.dev/">
  vite
</a>, developer experience is great. You can start using TailwindCSS, TypeScript,
and other tools right away.

<h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-2 mt-4">How does it work?</h2>

Of course you should read in detail on official website, but here are highlights

<div class="px-4">
  <ol class="list-disc my-2">
    <li class="list-item">
      <span class="font-bold block">Delay Execution</span>
      Delay execution of JavaScript as much as possible. <span class="italic">
        At its simplest, a Qwik application only needs about 1KB of JavaScript
        to become interactive
      </span>ðŸ¤¯.
    </li>
    <li class="list-item">
      <span class="font-bold block">Resumability & Serialization</span>One of
      the major differentiators of Qwik is that it is designed to be resumable
      and serializable. This means that the execution of the application can be
      paused and resumed at any point in time. This enables seamless execution
      from where the server left off, avoiding the need for rebuilding data
      structures and attaching listeners in the browser.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="italic text-gray-500 mt-2">
  Now, you might be wondering, what if my network is slow? In that case, it
  would take some time to load the JavaScript; once it loads, it will only
  execute it and perform the desired action.
</div>

Well, Qwik has a solution for that as well. It loads the JavaScript chunks in the background using a service worker, which doesn't affect the main thread. So, before you click on a link, the JavaScript is already loaded in the background.

<div class="my-2" />
<h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-2 mt-4">Performance</h2>

The page you are looking at right now is built using Qwik and it's not loading
any JavaScript file. It has only added just a bit of JS in one of the script
tags to load the required code.

<code class="code my-2">
  Most important thing to note here is that that the{" "}
  <span class="font-bold">Total Blocking Time</span>
  is <span>0 ms</span>
</code>

Which means that there is no JavaScript blocking the main thread.

<div class="mt-2">Here is a screenshot from the Chrome Dev Tools.</div>

</a>
As I am using images from github.com and svgporn.com, the Largest Contentful
Paint is not very good. I will try to improve it in the future.

<h2 class="text-gray-600 text-xl mb-2 mt-4 italic">
  I am loving it so far. Will keep you posted on my experience with Qwik.
